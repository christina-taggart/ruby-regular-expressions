# Ruby Drill Regular Expressions 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Ruby's `String` class has over [100 public methods](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html) that give Ruby programmers a remarkable power to process, manipulate, and transform textual data. About a dozen of those `String` methods use Regular Expressions in order to allow for high-powered string matching. 

An example of low-powered string matching is when you use your browser's search (âŒ˜f on a Mac) for a specific word, say, your own name. What if you wanted to search your browser for anything that matches the pattern for a social security number? For that, you'd use Regular Expressions.

As you work through the exercises of this challenge, we recommend you use [http://rubular.com](http://rubular.com) to help you code your regex.  Refer to the [Pickaxe Guide](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/language.html#UJ) or this [overview](http://www.bluebox.net/about/blog/2013/02/using-regular-expressions-in-ruby-part-1-of-3/) if you get stuck!

## Objectives

* Use the driver code in the gist to guide you to a working solution. 
* Add additional driver code where you want to feel more comfortable with your implementation. For instance, what happens when you pass a string with only a single SSN into the `hide_all_ssns` or `get_all_ssns`  methods?
* Did adding driver code helped you solve the challenge more effectively? How? (Answer in the gist as a comment)
